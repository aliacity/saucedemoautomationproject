        2. ' cd <your desirred project name> '
        3. ' npm init-y '
        4. ' npm install cypress '
      
  3. Once cypress is installed you can open the cypress application using the following command
       ' npx cypress open '
       
  4. Next youll need to clone this repository into your project folder
